# RAMESES
python code for the implementation of rameses.
Rameses is a two-player game that requires a board having an n Ã— n grid and n^2 pebbles. 
Initially the board starts empty.Player 1 picks up a pebble and places it in any square of the grid. 
Player 2 then picks up a pebble from the pile, and places it in any open square.
A player loses the game as soon as they place a pebble that completes a row, 
a column, or one of the two diagonals of the board, and then the other player wins.
